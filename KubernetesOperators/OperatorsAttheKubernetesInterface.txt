Operators extend two kubernetes concepts: resources and Controllers
The kubernetes API inslcudes a machanism, the CRD for defining new resources
Kubernetes objects Operators build on to add new capabilities to a cluster 
It will help you decide how Operators fit into the Kubernetes architecture and why it is valable to make an application a Kubernetes native

Standard Scaling: The ReplicaSet Resource 
-> Looking at a standard resource, the ReplicaSet gives a sense of hose resourecs comprise the applicaiton management database at the heart
    of kubernetes
-> Liek any other reosurece in the Kubernetes API the ReplicaSet is a collection of API objects 
_> The ReplicaSet basically just collects pod objects, forming a list of running replicas of an application 
-> IN standard kubernetes, a ReplicasSet controller manages replicasets and the pods belonging to them 
    -> RS controllers creates Rs and monitors them
