- The most difficult part of learning how to apply containers is in translating the needs of the software you are tyring to isolate

* Running Software in containers
    - Docker calls the collection of files and instructions needed to run a program an image 
    - $ docker run --detach --name web nginx:latest
        -> Downloads, installss, and starts a drtached nginx container from Docker Hub
    - Detached containers are a perfect fit for containers you want to run in the background, (like a daemon or a service)
    - Iteractive containers
        $ docker run --interactive --tty --link web:web --name web_test busybox /bin/sh
        -> This starts a virtual terminal 
            --interactive option tells Docker to keep the stanard input stream open for the container even if there is no 
                terminal attached
            --tty option tell sDocker to allocation a virtual terminal for the container, which will allow you to pass signals
                to the terminal 
            /bin/sh was used to specify the program to run inside the shell
